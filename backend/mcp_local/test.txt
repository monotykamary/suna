Author manuscript; available in PMC: 2024 Nov 1. Abstract \\n Artificial Intelligence (AI) in oncology is advancing beyond algorithm development to integration into clinical practice. This review describes the current state of the field, with a specific focus on clinical integration. AI applications are structured according to cancer type and clinical domain, focusing on the four most common cancers and tasks of detection, diagnosis, and treatment. These applications encompass various data modalities, including imaging, genomics, and medical records. We conclude with a summary of existing challenges, evolving solutions, and potential future directions for the field. Introduction \\n Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied to all aspects of oncology. These applications have been set in motion by two fundamental shifts. The first is the development of new computational models and tools. In particular, advances in deep learning 1 over the past decade have made it feasible to learn complex patterns directly from real-world data, making it the core driver of AI advances in and out of healthcare 2. These advances in deep learning have been accompanied with rapid advances in graphical processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing that enable the development of increasingly large models trained on massive data sets. The second shift is the advancing digital landscape of oncology itself. This includes the storage of patient data in electronic medical record (EMR) systems, the digitization of radiology and pathology imaging 3, and the increasing adoption of routine genomic profiling 4. While this digitization is non-uniform across data modalities and clinical sites, there is increasing availability of detailed, longitudinal information for cancer patients. This data can be used to build and train AI models, and critically, the real-time availability of this data can enable individualized, clinically relevant AI predictions to further the goal of precision oncology 5. \\n Within this review, we aim to summarize the current landscape of AI in oncology. While the field can encompass numerous applications, including biological and drug discovery 6, this review specifically focuses on AI use cases targeting direct integration into clinical practice. This focus is motivated by the accelerated advancement of AI applications from development to clinical use. Additionally, we focus on AI approaches based on modern, deep learning methods, rather than other machine learning or rule-based methods. Finally, given the numerous possible applications and breadth of AI work, the review focuses on the four most common cancer types: Breast, Prostate, Lung, and Colorectal, accounting for 50% of all new cancer cases in 2023 7. AI applications for these cancer types serve as a good representation of the current state of the field, especially as their prevalence facilitates large-scale data collection and encourages clinical application. \\n To first motivate\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/favicons/favicon-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11843581/\",\n      \"title\": \"Exploring the role of artificial intelligence in chemotherapy development, cancer diagnosis, and treatment: present achievements and future outlook\",\n      \"url\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11843581/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-02-04T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"score\": 0.4119340777397156,\n      \"text\": \"\\n \\n \\n \\n Abstract \\n Background \\n Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in oncology, offering promising applications in chemotherapy development, cancer diagnosis, and predicting chemotherapy response.

While progress has been made in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer patients, individualized and data-driven care remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI), which is used to predict and automate many cancers, has emerged as a promising option for improving healthcare accuracy and patient outcomes. AI applications in oncology include risk assessment, early diagnosis, patient prognosis estimation, and treatment selection based on deep knowledge. Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from training data, has been highly effective at predicting various types of cancer, including breast, brain, lung, liver, and prostate cancer. In fact, AI and ML have demonstrated greater accuracy in predicting cancer than clinicians. These technologies also have the potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and quality of life of patients with various illnesses, not just cancer. Therefore, it is important to improve current AI and ML technologies and to develop new programs to benefit patients. This article examines the use of AI and ML algorithms in cancer prediction, including their current applications, limitations, and future prospects. \\n Keywords: machine learning, artificial intelligence, treatment selection, cancer diagnosis, cancer-related mortality Introduction \\n Cancer is a significant public health issue globally, marked by an elevated incidence and mortality rate. 1 According to the GLOBOCAN 2020 database, approximately 19.3 million new cases and 10 million deaths have been reported annually. 2 Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with expected 1.8 million fatalities, followed by stomach, liver, colorectal, and breast cancer. 2 The prevention and treatment of cancer remain difficult. 3 After heart disease, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. In 2023, there are projected to be 1.9 million new cancer cases (equivalent to around 5370 cases per day) and 609,820 deaths from cancer (equivalent to around 1670 deaths per day) in the US. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has released a poster on known causes and prevention by organ site of human cancer. A description of known causes and prevention by organ site is provided in Figure S1. \\n The “Global Cancer Observatory” reports indicate that on a global scale, 37 individuals are diagnosed with cancer and over 19 individuals succumb to the disease every minute. Figure 1A shows the number of new cases in 2020 and Figure 1B shows the number of deaths in 2020 due to all cancers.\\n \\n Figure 1. \\n \\n The number of new cancer cases reported in 2020 and the number of deaths caused by these cancers.
